<h2>Description</h2>

This is a project I did for the C Class lessons I follow at public Institute of Vocational Training in Galatsi, Greece. It is a kind of database for cars made with C language. User can search for existing cars, import new cars, delete cars, fix car's info etc. There are certain bugs I need to fix though.
